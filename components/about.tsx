          Hello! My name is Mohamed NOUI and I enjoy creating things that live
          on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2018
          when I was studying for the computer science degree. Fast-forward to
          today, my main focus these days is building accessible, responsive
          products and digital experiences for a variety of clients.
          <br />
          <br />
          Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve been working with recently: <br />
          <br />
          <span
            className="text-xl
          "
          >
            React | Tailwind | Javascript | Node.js
          </span>
        </p>

        <img className="rounded-3xl  sm:w-80 " src="./profile.jpg" alt="" />
      </div>
    </motion.section>
  );
}
